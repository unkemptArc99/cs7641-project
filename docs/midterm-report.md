title: Comparing Image Clustering/Classification performance between Supervised and Unsupervised Learning models using Dog Breed Image dataset
---

## Overview
### Background

### Problem Definition


## Data Exploration and Cleaning


## Supervised Learning Models
Methods 
describe cnns and do calculations for number of parameters
Results and Discussion 

All groups should have their dataset cleaned at this point (justification for why we didnt need cleaning)

We expect to see data pre-processing in your project such as feature selection (Forward or backward feature selection, dimensionality reduction methods such as PCA, Lasso, LDA, .. ), taking care of missing features in your dataset, ... (data augmentation to prevent overfitting, balance dataset to get even results across breeds)

We expect to see at least one supervised or unsupervised method implemented and the results need to be studied in details. For example evaluating your predictive model performance using different metrics (take a look at ML Metrics) 

## Unsupervised Learning Models
